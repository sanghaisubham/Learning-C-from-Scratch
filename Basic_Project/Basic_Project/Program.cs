/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~OOPS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
/*
 * Uses Objects in Programming.
 * Aims to implement real world entities like inheritance,hiding,polymorphism etc.
 * Helps to bind together data and functions into single unit , preventing external access of this data.(Data Hidingor Encapsulation)
 * Inheritance in OOPS helps to remove writing redundant code.
 * Allows multiple instances of an object to coexist without any interference and communicating among themselves
 * by various message passing techniques.
 */

/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~CLass~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
/*Class is a  user defined data type like structures and unions.
 * A Class holds its own data member and member functions which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
 * Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables 
 * and together these data member and  member functions define the properties of the objects in the class.
 * Class do not utilise space in memory;
 * They are Blueprint or model of data and functions or methods.
 * Conceptual representation(definiition) of all entities(instances) that share common attributes and behaviors
 * */

/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Object~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
/*
 * Instance of a class.
 * Takes up space in memory.
 * Object contains data and code to manipulate the data.
 * Has individual copy of common attributes and share common set of behaviors.
